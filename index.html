                    We make Live, Push and Link — unique software and hardware for music creation and performance. With these products, our
                    community of users creates amazing things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live in 2001. Our products are used by a community of
                    dedicated musicians, sound designers, and artists from across the world.

                    Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.
                </p>
                <p>
                We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion for what we make,
                and the people we make it for.

                We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in
                Los Angeles and Tokyo.

                <p>
                Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide
                range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere
                in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to
                something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.

                <p>
                    Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their magic and grow.
                    We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and thus able to
                    explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are
                    valued and openly encouraged.

                    Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and
                    coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music salons are a chance to
                    discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.
